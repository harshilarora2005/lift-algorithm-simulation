# Lift Algorithm Comparison  

## Overview  
The Lift Algorithm Comparison project is a web-based application designed to visualize and compare the efficiency of various lift scheduling algorithms. The project demonstrates how different algorithms perform when processing the same set of floor requests, providing insights into their effectiveness and efficiency.  

## Features  
- **Dynamic Floor Visuals**: Intuitive and engaging visuals representing buildings, floors, and lift movements.  
- **Interactive Controls**: Floor buttons for requesting lifts and starting simulations.  
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Compare multiple algorithms side-by-side based on metrics like wait time and total distance traveled.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time statistics displayed for each algorithm during simulations.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**:  
  - HTML5: Structure and layout.  
  - CSS3: Styling and animations.  
  - JavaScript: Logic and interactivity.  

- **Backend**:  
  - PHP: Server-side scripting.  
  - MySQL: Data storage for logging results.  

## Setup  
### Prerequisites  
- A web server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or LAMP) to run PHP scripts.  
- A modern browser for the frontend.  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lift-algorithm-comparison.git
   cd lift-algorithm-comparison
